# Identifying Fraudulent Job Postings with Machine Learning

## Project Summary

This project tackles a binary classification task with severely class imbalanced target variable, requiring the use of resampling methods. The feature variables have high dimensionality and a mixture of types: text, categorical, binary and structured string data. Feature selection and NLP techniques, including word embeddings, were used. Models used were Random Forest Classifiers, and Neural Networks using the keras functional API.

This project was completed as part of an MSc in Data Science at Goldsmiths, University of London and has two parts: code - avaliable in the Jupyter notebook, and a written report - please see the PDF.
